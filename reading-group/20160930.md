Dmitri Dolgov, Sebastian Thrun, Michael Montemerlo, James Diebel


# Junior

* DARPA Urban Challenge 2007
* Stanford Racing Team's robot
* widely used as proof-of-concept



# Challenges

1. path-planning as non-linear optimization problem
2. cost function over paths


# Challenge 1.

## Hybrid-State A\*
 - not guaranteed optimal
 - near global optimum
 - driveable


# Heuristics for Challenge 1.

## non-holonomic-without-obstacles
 - the shortest path computed
 - 2D Euclidean distance computed
 - maximum used

## holonomic-with-obstacles
 - dynamic programming in 2D


# Analytic Expansion for Challenge 1.

## Reed-Shepp
 - for some nodes
 - obstacle free path to destination
 - used when collision-free


# Visualization for Challenge 1.

# Challenge 2.

## Voronoi Field
 - scaled to available space
 - narrow openings remain navigable

# Hybrid-State A\* result

* driveable, but unnecessary steering
* near optimum, but still suboptimal
* therefore Hybrid-State A\* postprocessed


# Optimization and Smoothing

1. non-linear optimization program
2. non-parametric interpolation


# Stage 1.

Objective function including Voronoi field, maximum allowable curvature, penalization of collision, non-holonomic constraints and measurement of the smoothness.

- on the coorinates of the vertices
- improves the length and smoothness

# Stage 2.

The path is super-sampled by adding new vertices and conjugate gradient method is used to minimize curvature while original vertices holds fixed.
