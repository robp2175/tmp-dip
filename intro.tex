\label[intro]\chap Introduction

The Real-Time Publish-Subscribe (\glref{RTPS})\cite[OMG:DDSI-RTPS22] is the protocol of Data Distribution Service (\glref{DDS})\cite[OMG:DDS] family. It supports Data-Centric Publish-Subscribe communication for real-time applications in a decentralized network. Specification of protocol is maintained by Object Management Group\cite[www:OMG] - international, open membership, not-for-profit technology standards consortium, since version 1.0 on February 2002 till version 2.2 on September 2014. \glref{ORTE} was finished before version 1.0 of \glref{DDS} specification of \glref{RTPS} protocol and was used as proof of concept. \glref{ORTE} was also implemented in some interesting projects as aerodynamic wind tunel, networked vehicle systems and Eurobot2008 \cite[ORTE:conf].

This thesis aims on upgrading \glref{ORTE} implementation of \glref{RTPS} protocol in order to achieve compatibility with the latest standard version 2.2. Good understanding of \glref{RTPS} standard nad actual \glref{ORTE} implementation is required. In Chapter \ref[intro], there is an introduction to \glref{RTPS} and \glref{ORTE}. Chapter \ref[compare] provides overview of the latest \glref{RTPS} protocol version 2.2 with the section dedicated for comparison with version 1.0 of the protocol. Changes made for achieving the compatibility with version 2.2 of the \glref{RTPS} protocol is covered in chapter \ref[upgrade], chapter \ref[test] documents results of updated \glref{ORTE} implementation testing and possible future development is disussed in \ref[future]. In chapter \ref[shape], demo application of \glref{ORTE} called {\em Shape} for Android is introduced. Original ORTE version based demonstration application has been developed as part of preparation for main work to gain experience with RTPS protocol and its implementation. Security considerations and proposal for security protocol extension is discussed in chapter \ref[sec].
