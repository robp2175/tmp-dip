\label[intro]\chap Introduction

The Real-Time Publish-Subscribe (\glref{RTPS})\cite[OMG:DDSI-RTPS22] is the protocol of Data Distribution Service (\glref{DDS})\cite[OMG:DDS] family, supporting Data-Centric Publish-Subscribe in real time and specifying communication in a decentralized network, where multiple nodes needs to send and/or receive data in real time. Specification of protocol is developed by Object Management Group\cite[www:OMG] - international, open membership, not-for-profit technology standards consortium, since version 1.0 on February 2002 till version 2.2 on September 2014.

This thesis aims on upgrading \glref{ORTE} implementation of \glref{RTPS} protocol to be compatible with the latest standard version 2.2. The structure is as follows. In Chapter \ref[intro], there is an introduction to \glref{RTPS} and \glref{ORTE}. Chapter \ref[compare] compares implemented \glref{RTPS} 1.0 with the latest \glref{RTPS} 2.2, chapter \ref[upgrade] covers changes needed for compatibility with version 2.2 of the \glref{RTPS} protocol and chapter \ref[test] covers testing of new implementation of \glref{RTPS} protocol in \glref{ORTE}. In chapter \ref[shape], demo application of \glref{ORTE} called {\em Shape} for Android is introduced. Original ORTE version based demonstration application has been developed as part of preparation for main work to gain experience with RTPS protocol and its implementation. Security for \glref{DDS} is discussed in chapter \ref[sec].
