## OFF-LINE
### Classic
* Voronoi
* visibility graph

### Evolutionary
* Genetic Algorithm (GA)
* Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
* Anto Colony Optimization (ACO)
* Simulated Annealing (SA)

## ON-LINE
### Classic
* Artificial Potential Field (APF)
* vector field histogram
* collision cone concept
* dynamic windows approach

### Evolutionary
* Evolutionary APF (EAPF)
* collision cone and PSO
* PSO and stream functions (or potential flows)
* PSO and potential field
* APF and dynamic model of velocity potential field (by quantum PSO)
* hybrid ACO (for global path) and APF (for local route)
* improved ACO (altered pheromone) and potential field
* APF with SA considering goal non-reachable with obstacles nearby (GNRON)
* multioperator base SA
