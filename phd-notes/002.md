# Behere, Sagar, and Martin TÃ¶rngren. "A functional reference architecture for autonomous driving." Information and Software Technology 73 (2016): 136-150.

Functional reference architecture for autonomous driving is considered in this paper. Perception, decision and control and vehicle platform components are discussed, architecture is divided in two layers - vehicle platform and a cognitive driving intelligence layers. Clean split between the driving intelligence and the vehicle platform is recommended.
