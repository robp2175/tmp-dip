# Werling, Moritz, et al. "Optimal trajectory generation for dynamic street scenarios in a frenet frame." Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2010 IEEE International Conference on. IEEE, 2010.

Optimal control based solution for generating trajectory proposed.

## Problems
* Under simplified conditions (i.e. DARPA), driving maneuvers can be tackled
  with simple heuristic anc conservative estimates.
* In real world situations (highway, high traffic/driving speed), trajectory
  concepts come into play.

## Related works
* Find global trajectory, but lack unpredictatbility of the other traffic.
* Trajectory planning follow a discrete optimization scheme: A finite set of
  trajectories computed. Then trajectory with min cost function selected.

## Frenet Frame
## Lateral movement
## Longitudinal movement
## Combining lateral and longitudinal
