"A robot is *holonomic* if the controllable degrees of freedom are equal to the
total degrees of freedom."

Trajectory planning (lowest level) - smooth trajectory, vehicular dynamics,
small (local) search space of high dimensional states.

## Problems
* path-planning - finding a geometric path from start to end, such that all
  conf and state on the path are feasible.
* manoeuvre planning - taking the best high-level decision for the vehicle
  depending on path
* trajectory planning - RT planning of transition from one feasible state to
  the next (kinemitic limit, navigation comfort (ISO 2631-1 1997), lane
  boundaries, traffic rules avoiding obstacles, ... dependent)

## Trajectory algorithms
1. trajectory generation in lower dimensional search space
2. resulting optimal trajectory + smoothing

# Steps for route planning
1. generate search space

  * search in continusous coordinates, use only road boundaries and obstacles
    positions
  * decomposition techniques - analyse the space with higher resolution, include
    Voronoi Diagrams, occupancy grids, cost maps, lattices

2. finding the best geometric path

  1. find the best sequence of actions (incremental search)
  2. find the best action from multiple final states (local search)

3. find the best manoeuvre
4. find the best trajectory (optimisation of geometric curve, according to
   given constraints)
