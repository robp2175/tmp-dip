# ETSI, TR. "102 863 (V1. 1.1)." Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), Vehicular Communications, Basic Set of Applications, Local Dynamic Map (LDM) Rationale for and Guidance on Standardization (2011).

## Local Dynamic Map (LDM)
* Layered, implemented as db.
* Table for each object in LDM.
* Contains info on real-world and conceptual objects that have influence on the traffic flow.
* Host info (vehicle internal sensor data) will not be available in LDM.

## Data categorization
* Type 1: permanent static data (by map data suplier)j
  * not in LDM
* Type 2: transient static data (traffic signs)
* Type 3: transient dynamic data (weather, traffic)
* Type 4: highly dynamic data (pedestrians, cars)
  * Co-operative Awareness Message (CAM)

## LDM functional requirements
* receive info (DENMs, CAMs, TPEG) + plausibility check
* store and protect relevant info for requiredtime
* provide accurate info to authorized apps
* enable apps to store and protect relevant results to share with others

## LDM architecture
* LDM Management
  * info management
  * subscription/notification
  * info access

* Data Store

## LDM API
* apps (LDM FA-SAP)
* networking (LDM NF-SAP)
* security (LDM SF-SAP)

## Info stored in LDM
* location (WGS84), 3 types: point, segment, area

* Type 1: No permanent, static info required in LDM.
* Type 2: No transient, static info specified in LDM
  * Apps may define type 2 objects.
  * LDM should be able to store and manage type 2 objects.
* Type 3:
  * temporary speed limit
  * current status of traffic signals
  * locations and dimenzions of hazard (incl. stationary vehicles, weather)
  * temporary changes in lane/road directions restrictions
  * designed progression speed through linked traffic signals
  * revise route descriptor
  * position of temporary points of interest
  * position and meaning of temporary signs (not in map data)
* Type 4:
  * current status of all ITS within range of the host
