# Scientific Writing

## Week 1 - Typical Mistakes

### Grammar
1. no articles
  * singular, countable => the
  * name (including Figure X, Chapter Y) => nothing
  * uncountable => nothing
  * many possibilities => a
2. no prepositions
  * in case of (guess?)
  * in *the* case of (one of)
  * an increase *in* (what)
  * an increase *of* (how much)
3. subjects
  * subjects in each sentense
  * world order in sentence: SVO (subject, verb, object)
4. capitalization, punctuation
  * extra info => divided by commas
5. connectors and linking words
  * but, so => not at start (after comma)
  * however => not in the middle
  * completely independent => two sentences
6. tenses
  * don't jump between them

### Stylistics
7. being concise
8. avoiding ambiguity
9. avoiding redundancy


## Week 2 - ???

Section with (!) in name should be the 2nd nature (the most important).

### Possession

* possessive singular of nouns: add 's
* excaptions for ancient proper names
* pronominal possessives *hers*, *its*, *theirs*, *yours*, *ours*: no apostrophe
* indefinite pronouns: with apostrophe

### Serial comma

* three or more terms with a single conjunction: comma after each term except the last
* excaptions usually in names of business firms

### Parenthetic comma (!)

* parenthetic expressions between commas
* dates usually contain parenthetic words, but it is customary to omit (12 November 2016 is good)
* name or title in direct address is parenthetic
* abbreviations etc., i.e., e.g. are parenthetic
* abbreviations for academic degrees, and titles that follow a name are parenthetic
* noun and restrictive term of identification: no comma
* noun and nonrestrictive relatives are parenthetic
  * nonrestrictive does not serve to identify/define the antecedent noun
* similar clauses indicating time or place are parenthetic
* restrictive clauses are not parenthetic
  * cannot be split into to independent statements
  * same for participial phrases and appositives
* subordinate cluase or phrase before main clause: use comma

### Independent clause (!)

* use comma before conjunction for independent clause
* second part of sentence starts by *as*, *for*, *or*, *nor*, *while*: use comma
  * *as* in the sense of *because*
  * others in the sense of *and at the same time*
* same subject for both clauses expressed only once
  * use comma for *but*
  * do not use comma for *and*

### Semicolon (!)

* two or more clauses grammatically complete needs to be joined: use semicolon
  * semicolon replaceable by end of sentence
* when conjunction is used: use comma
* when adverb is used: use semicolon
* very short clauses: use comma
* easy and conversional tone of the sentence: use comma

### Do not break sentences in two (!)

* do not use periods for commas

### Colon

* more effect than the comma
* less power than the semicolon
* more formality than the dash

* after and independent clause to introduce:
  * a list of particulars,
  * an appositive,
  * an amplification,
  * an illustrative quotation
* join two independent clauses if the 2nd interprets/amplifies the 1st
* introduce quotation that supports/contributes to the preceding clause
* to follow the salutation of a formal letter
* to separate hour from minute
* to separate title of a work from its subtitle

### Dash

* stronger than comma
* less format than a colon
* more relaxed than parentheses

* set off an abrupt break/interruption
* announce a long appositive/summary
* use only when a more common mark is inadequate

### The number of the verb

* # subject -> # verb
* words between subject and verb do not affect # verb
* singular verb after *each*, *either*, *everyone*, *everybody*, *neither*, ,*nobody*, *someone*
* singular verb with *none* if *none* means "no one" or "not one"
* plural verb with *none* if *none* suggest more than one thing/person
* two or more nouns joined by *and* forming compound sujbect: almost always plural verb
* certain compounds, cliches, *each*, or *every*: singular verb
* singular subject is singular even if connected to other nouns by:
  * *with*
  * *as well as*
  * *in addition to*
  * *excapt*
  * *together with*
  * *no less than*
* linking verb agrees with # its subject
* some nouns looking like plural are singular

### Case of pronoun

* personal pronouns + who change form as subject/object
* who introducing subordinate clause: case depends on its function in that clause
* pronoun is nominative if it is the subject of a stated/understood verb
  * avoid understood verb by supplying them
* use the simple personal pronoun as a subject
* possessive pronouns show ownership
  * adjectival modifier (before subject)
  * noun form (after subject)
* gerunds usually require the possessive
* present participle as a verbal require the objective

### Must refer to the grammatical subject

* participial phrase at the beginning
* participal phrase preceded by:
  * a conjunction,
  * preposition,
  * nouns in apposition,
  * adjectives,
  * and adjective phrases
