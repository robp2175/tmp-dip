============
Five classic components of a computer
-------------------------------------
* input
* output
* memory
* datapath
* control

Datapath + control sometimes combined to processor.

Abstraction, architecture, implementation
-----------------------------------------
* layers hiding details from the layer above is *abstraction*
* *instruction set architecture* is the interface between hardware and
  low-level software
* architecture (abstract interface) enables many *implementations*

CPU performance
---------------
`Time = Seconds/Program = Instructions/Program * Clock cycles/Instruction *
Seconds/Clock cycle`

Two key principles
------------------
* Instructions represented as numbers.
* Programs stored in memory (to be read/written), like numbers.

Equations
=========
CPU performance equation
------------------------
Classic CPU performance equation: `CPU time = Instruction count * CPI * Clock
cycle time` or `CPU time = Instruction count * CPI / Clock rate`

* *CPI* - Clock cycles per instruction.
* *IPC* - Instruction per clcok cycle (`1/CPI`).

Notes
=====
Program performance depends on algorithm (instruction count, CPI), programming
language (instruction count, CPI), compiler (instruction count, CPI),
instruction set architecture (instruction count, clock rate, CPI).

Hardware design principles
==========================
1. Simplicity favors regularity.
2. Smaller is faster.
3. Make the common case fast.
4. Good design demands good compromises.

Instruction types
=================
* R-type (register)
    * ( op (6b), rs (5b), rt (5b), rd (5b), shamt (5b), funct (6b) )
* I-type (immediate)
    * ( op (6b), rs (5b), rt (5b), constant or address (16b) )
* J-type (jump)
    * ( op (6b), address (26b) )
    * ( op (6b), rs (5b), rt (5b), address (16b) )

Translate program
=================
Compiler: C -> assembly
Assembler: assembly -> object
Linker: object -> executable
Loader: Executable -> memory
