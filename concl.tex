\label[concl]\chap Conclusion

The aim of this thesis was upgrading Open Real-Time Ethernet implementation of Real-Time Publish-Subscribe protocol in order to achieve compatibility with the actual protocol version. Actual protocol version was introduced and compared to implemented version. Required changes was discussed, implementation of basic types, messages and behavior was introduced and future development was outlined. Also demo application and possibilities of security in implementation.

The main difference between implemented and actual version is that traffic used for internal purposes of protocol differs from user data traffic just in identification of endpoints. There are also differences in behavior and messages.

As the result, basic types was upgraded and added, messages was changed and new kind of behavior was implemented. However the second type of behavior is still missing and discovery is implemented partially.
